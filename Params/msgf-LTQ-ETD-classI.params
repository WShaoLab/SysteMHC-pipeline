#  0 means unspecific cleavage (cleave after any residue)
#  1 means Trypsin (Default); optionally use this along with NTT=0 for a no-enzyme-specificity search of a tryptically digested sample

# Isotope error range
#  Takes into account the error introduced by not choosing the monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#  Useful for accurate precursor ion masses.
#  Ignored if the parent mass tolerance is > 0.5Da or 500ppm.
#  The combination of -t and -ti determines the precursor mass tolerance.
#  e.g. "-t 20ppm -ti -1,2" tests abs(observed - theoretical - n * 1.00335Da) < 20ppm for n=-1, 0, 1, 2

# Number of tolerable termini

# Number of Threads (by default, uses all available cores)
NumThreads=24

#tasks NumTasks (Default: internally calculated based on inputs)
#Use this to manually set the number of tasks to create for the search.
#More tasks than threads will reduce the memory requirements of the search, but will be slower (how much depends on the inputs).
#If the spectrum file is particularly large, a larger number of tasks will decrease the possibility of out of memory errors.
#If the fasta file being searched is larger than 10MB, more tasks will cause a noticeably longer search time.
#1 <= tasks <= numThreads: will create one task per thread, which is the original behavior.
#tasks = 0: use default calculation - minimum of :(threads*3), and (numSpectra/250).
#tasks < 0: multiply number of threads by abs(tasks) to determine number of tasks (i.e., -2 => "2 * numThreads" tasks).
#One task per thread will use the most memory, but will usually finish the fastest.
#2-3 tasks per thread will use comparably less memory, but may cause the search to take 1.5 to 2 times as long with a 23MB fasta file.
